Intuition: A palindrome string can be assumed as if mirror is placed in
           between the string so all the character before and after are same.
           So there can be two possibility for middle point.
           If length is even then middle point divide into equal half
           whereas if length of string is odd then one character should
           overlap with middle point to divide into two equal half.
           So we will use each character as a middle point and expand
           left and right to till our left character is equal to right character.
           For each middle point we have to check for two cases if length can be even of odd.
        

Time complexity is O(n2); as for each character we are expanding left and right in worst case(if all character are same)
                          we will traverse all character.
Space complexity is O(1);
