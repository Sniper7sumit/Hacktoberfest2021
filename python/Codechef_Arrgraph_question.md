#### codechef ARRGRAPH question

```
You are given a sequence of integers A1,A2,…,AN. You may change any number of its elements (possibly zero), 
obtaining a new sequence of positive integers B1,B2,…,BN. Each element of B must be an integer between 2 and 50
(both inclusive).

Let's define an undirected graph G
with N vertices (numbered 1 through N). For each pair of different vertices i and j, there is an edge between i and j 
if and only if Bi and Bj are coprime.

You should choose the sequence B
in such a way that G is a connected graph. The number of elements which need to be changed to obtain B from A should be 
minimum possible. Find one such sequence B and the minimum required number of changes.
It can be proven that a solution always exists — it is always possible to modify sequence A
in such a way that G is connected.
